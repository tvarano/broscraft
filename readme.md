Hey! here's the worlds from my minecraft server over the summer.

to use them, just download the file (should come as a .zip). it's around 3gb uncompressed, so it should take a while.

when it's downloaded, unzip the files and put the respective folders in your .minecraft directory. on windows, it's probably C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft

on mac, it's probably /Users/\<username\>/Library/Application Support/minecraft


put the folders in the "saves" directory and then open minecraft. they should be there as local worlds.
